# Hospital-Management-System
This is a project to create a Hospital Database Management System from both the perspectives of Patients and Doctors. 
The project was created using HTML5, CSS, PHP and MySQL. The website has multiple functionalities for both Doctors and Patients.
The website is handled to support concurrent transactions. The transactions are designed to be secure with efficient rollbacks and Isolation.
